# Hanoi-2-Colors
The basic Hanoi Tower differs only in the size of the plate. There are three sizes of plates in this project, and each size plate has two colors. The two-color and three-color Hanoi Tower can be realized through recursion. However, in some cases, recursive processing is not universal. Spirit pills usually consume a lot of resources, such as stacking themselves, which consumes memory. Therefore, for efficiency, dynamic planning algorithms are carried out to record the best solution of subtasks, avoid repeated calculations of subtasks, and be efficient in solving the problem.
